# Hollowlight — Campaign State of Record

> Maintained by the Conductor (ox-alpha session). Every heartbeat: read this, advance exactly one step, update it. Builders and critics never edit this file.

- **Project:** Hollowlight — mobile-first idle RPG benchmarked vs Melvor Idle 1 & 2.
- **Repo:** https://github.com/teabonetv/hollowlight · Live: https://teabonetv.github.io/hollowlight/
- **Method:** fresh-agent builder lanes in git worktrees (`wt-*`), verified + merged by Conductor, then a FRESH hostile critic per lane judges the LIVE game blind against Melvor 1/2 with a forced verdict. Loss ⇒ named single biggest gap ⇒ builder re-round. No fixed round count. Between major waves: one fresh whole-game player/smoothing agent.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Wave | 1 — dispatch pending |
| Active lanes | — (F1 merged; F1 critic re-dispatch in flight) |
| Merged | F1 @ f1e52d6 (89/89 tests green on main; Pages deploy success) |
| Critic verdicts | — |
| Next | **CAMPAIGN PAUSED by Luke 13:54** — resume = re-dispatch F1 critic (brief pattern in conductor heartbeat prompt) → verdict gates Wave 1 (S1,S2,S4) |

- 2026-08-24 F1 verified (89/89 tests in lane incl. headless app-boot), merged --no-ff to main @ f1e52d6, pushed; Pages deploy success, live 200. F1 critic dispatch next.
- 2026-08-24 Critic attempt 1 died on browser approval wall → built tools/qa/drive.js (zero-dep CDP driver, committed).
